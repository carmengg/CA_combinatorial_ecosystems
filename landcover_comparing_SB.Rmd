toc()
# ~1 min

cats <- c("developed","barren","forest","shrub","grass","crop","wetland","water")

rownames(change819)<-cats
colnames(change819)<-cats

print("Santa Barbara land cover change, 2008 to 2019")
change819
```

ex of how to read table: entry at row=forest and col=shrub are the #pixels changed from forest to shrub




```{r}

change_tofrom <- change_df(change_mtx = change819, keep_equals = FALSE)
change_tofrom
```
